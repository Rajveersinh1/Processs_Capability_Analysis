# Processs_Capability_Analysis
This repository contains code for conducting process capability analysis in Python. The purpose of this analysis is to assess whether a process is capable of producing products within specified tolerance limits.


# Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the code:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scipy

# Usage
To run the process capability analysis, simply run the process_capability_analysis.py script in the repository. The script generates normally distributed data points with a specified target and standard deviation, and calculates the Cp, Cpk, and z-values for the process. It also provides summary statistics for the data and calculates the percentage of data points that fall outside of the specified tolerance limits.

# Results
The results of the process capability analysis are outputted to a text file called process_results.txt. This file includes information on the specifications, indices, and summary statistics for the data, as well as the percentage of data points that fall below the lower specification limit (LSL) and above the upper specification limit (USL).
